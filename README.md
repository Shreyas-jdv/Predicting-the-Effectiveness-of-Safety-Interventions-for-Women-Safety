# Predicting the Effectiveness of Safety Interventions for Women’s Safety

This project aims to predict the effectiveness of various safety interventions for women's safety using mathematical modeling and computational thinking. The goal is to analyze different interventions and estimate their impact based on factors such as budget, duration, and people reached.

## Project Overview

- **Topic:** Predicting the Effectiveness of Safety Interventions for Women’s Safety
- **Theme:** Mathematical Modeling and Computational Thinking
- **Tools Used:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Project Structure

- **Data Simulation:** The dataset is simulated to represent different types of safety interventions, including awareness campaigns, CCTV installation, street lighting, and police patrols.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations are created to understand the relationships between features and the target variable.
- **Modeling:** A Linear Regression model is built to predict the effectiveness score based on the given features.
- **Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2).
- **Visualization:** The results are visualized to compare actual vs. predicted effectiveness scores and analyze residuals.

## Requirements
